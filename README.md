# Additions
CAT reloaded task
An added mechanic that can make a flappy bird-type game more challenging is the addition of wind force, where if the wind is in the same direction of the bird's movement, the speed of the game is sped up, if opposite of the bird's movement then the game is slower since their will be a drag effect. both provide a challenge in the response time of the player. We can also add enemy A.I. birds that fly in the opposite direction of the bird, which provides more obstacles to avoid and this a moving obstacle.
